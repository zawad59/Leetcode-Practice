**Legit Hard Problem**

1st insert all the elements of the linked list into a stack (Last in First Out Mechanism comes to good
use here)

Run a loop till half the length of stack
**Till half because we need to merge the 2nd half of the linked list in a reverse way with 1st half**

Inside the for-loop make the connections and traversal to reorder according to the provided output

Make sure to point the final list element pointer to None

**Time Complexity: Stack used and for loop till N/2; hence O(n)**
**Space Complexity: No In Place list used apart from the linked list, so O(n)
