The key idea behind solving this problem is all the letters have to be exact same count in the two strings.
Also, if two strings are not of same length, they can not be anagrams. 
So, we store in two dictionaries where
the key is the letter and value is their count. 
We have to make sure if that letter is not there, then the 
hashmap returns 0. 
Then we match all the letters in both dictionaries with the exact count. Same hashmap returning
0 logic applies here.
