Here we use the sorted input array to our advantage
Set the Left pointer at the beginning of array
Set the right pointer at the end
Add the element at the left ptr to the element at the right ptr
If sum greater than target, understand that we need to go lower, so find lower element from the end of the list
If sum less than target, understand we need to go higher, so find higher element from the left ptr or starting element

**Process will work because problem statement describes guarantedd two elements**
**Intuitive Solution**
