**Not solved in a very time-efficient approach rather test case based solve**

Traverse the linked list to find out total number of nodes present
Subtract the nth node to be deleted from total no. of nodes to find the target node from the front
Just remove the target nodes connection from it's previous node

** Problem occurs when there are two nodes and n = 2 and we have to remove 1st node from the front **

Here print out the nodes or the temporary assigned nodes to find the exact conncection manuever
Keep one node for traversal, assign that node in the initialization phase to use the "Call by Reference" method
of linked list manuever
