Hashmap Approach: While traversing the list, if the element is not in the hashmap, insert it into the
hashmap and if the element is found, return True. Key thing to note here in the coding aspect, insert into 
the hashmap by using the elements as the key, because when you search for the element, the search will be
performed by key not by value.
