***Hard Problem***

1. First find out which portion of the sorted array we are in by comparing the left most value of array
with the middle value
2. Now see if the target is lower than the leftmost element and lower than middle value; If both conditions
true then search in the right portion of the array.
3. Also see if the target is higher than the leftmost element and higher than middle value; If both conditions
true then search in the right portion of the array.
4. If 2 and 3 don't suffice then search in left portion of the array.

5. Do the same when we are on the right sorted portion of the array.
6. See if the target is less than or equal to rightmost element and lower than middle value; If both conditions
true then search in the right portion of the array.
7. If condition 6 not true, searh in left portion of the array.
