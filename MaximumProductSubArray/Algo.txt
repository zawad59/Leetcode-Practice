Traverse forward and save the Max multiplication result when 0 encountered
Traverse backward and do the same.
Compare the max between forward and back traversal
Backward pass is needed because of edge cases like [3, 2, -3, -4, 3]
Also take care of edge cases where multiple 0's occur: [2 3 1 4 -2 -5 0 0]
