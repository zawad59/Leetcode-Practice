**Legit Hard Problem **

1. The solution needs us to solve it in O(1) space complexity, so appending elements in an array is not a solution by Hashmaps.
2. Find the result of XOR of all elements in the array.
3. The differing bit at first set to 1, then we need to find where exactly is the differing bit by AND operation with the XOR Result, the condition for
if statement has to be carefully written.
4. Once we find the exact differing bit, then iterate through the array to put each element in the array into two different places based on the differing bit.
5. The way to return the elements from the boxes/places is by XOR operation updated values in the box with the elements in the number array.
6. Step 5 needs to be done because from the two different boxes, we need to find the unique elements occurring just once in the list.
