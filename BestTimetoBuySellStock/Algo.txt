Use the two pointer approach here. Iterate the right pointer till the length of the array. 

In order to make profit, the left pointer value always have to be lower than the right pointer value.

So, if the left pointer is at a place greater thann the right pointer, we take the left pointer to the right pointer.

And increase the right pointer anyways. 

We update the maxProfit when the left pointer is smaller than right one.
