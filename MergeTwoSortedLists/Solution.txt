Initialize an empty node
Compare the values of the two lists, initialize the next pointer of the empty node to the value that is 
less between two lists
Iterate the lists and iterate the empty list

Take care of the edge cases where values may be present in one list and not the other

** Time Complexity: O(n + m) -> n and m being size of list 1 and list 2
** Space Complexity: O(1) -> Merging done in place, no extra memory was needed.
