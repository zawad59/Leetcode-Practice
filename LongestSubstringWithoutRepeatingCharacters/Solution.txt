***Sliding Window Problem***

1. The whole idea is to update the occurrence of a character in the HashMap appropriately. If any instance of a character is found again (Duplicate Occurrence), then update the left pointer with the updated position of the duplicate character in the HashMap.

2. Manage the MaxLen in a way that the left pointer is always at the updated position in the HashMap so that a string like "abcabcbb" does not yield
length 5 but yields length 3.
