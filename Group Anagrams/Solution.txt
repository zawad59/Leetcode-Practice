1. Initialize a HashMap where the values will be a list instead of an integer or a string.
2. Unlike regular insertion of HashMap, we need to append to the value list.
3. For step 2, the key will be the sorted string and the value will be the unsorted list.
4. Reason for doing that is keeping track of all the strings that can make the sorted string.
5. Sorted(str) creates just a list with the characters sorted in ascending order. Need to convert the sorted characters into string again because hashmap
keys can't accept list.


**Time Complexity: O(N * M * Log(M))
Sorting a string with length M takes M * log(M) time if there are M characters in the string. Since the parent list has N elements, so overall time complexity would be O(N* M * log (M))

**Space Complexity: O(N * M)
Again, M is the no. of chars in each string and N is the total no. of strings in the list.
