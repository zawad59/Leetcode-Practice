**Legit Hard Problem**

Address the problem by first doing two sum and two sum II
Find 1st value out of the triplets and then do two sum for rest of the two positions

**For removing duplicates: check the first value of the triplet with next value after sorting so that duplicate
triplets don't occur.

We can remove the duplicates by using another list, but solution faces TLE Error

** Look at the test cases for TLE Error: Most of them have same values all over the array.
To deal with this problem, update the left pointer to the next if the value at the left ptr is same as it's 
previous neighbor

** Both checking the i with next and left ptr with next are used to remove duplicate triplets
