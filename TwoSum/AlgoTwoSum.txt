When iterating the list, subtract elements from the target and push them to the hashmap only if the difference
from the target is not already contained in the hashmap. This way when it finds the difference in the hashmap,
the solution will return the index of the difference from the hashmap and also the currently traversing index.
This solution has linear time complexity and also does not need to traverse the entire list.
