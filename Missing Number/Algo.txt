Pretty Simple Solution for a FAANG Interview Question. Identify that n being length of the list would be representative of N natural numbers.

So using the formula n (n+1)/2 to find the sum of N natural numbers would be the first step. Then, we sum all the elements in the list. Then the subtraction of sum of array from n(n+1)/2

would give us the missing number.
