Use the two pointer approach here. Iterate the right pointer till the length of the array. In order to
make profit, the left pointer value always have to be lower than the right pointer value. So, if the left
pointer is at a place greater thann the right pointer, we take the left pointer to the right pointer. And increase
the right pointer anyways. We update the maxProfit when the left pointer is smaller than right one.
