Initialize the sum to the first element
Iterate through each element in the list to sum up the elements
Check if after adding the new element the currentSum exceeds the previous sum
Finally check if  the CurrentSum is the maximum sum as there could be one element larger than summing up all
elements and mostly due to the presence of negative numbers in the list
