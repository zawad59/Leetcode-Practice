This problem is a classic example of leetcode edge cases

Algorithm:

1. Use stack for pushing the open brackets if found in the list
2. Pop element from the stack and match with the character currently at the string for proper closing and opening braces
3. Write the conditionals properly to tackle the edge cases of matching opening and closing braces.
4. For cases like "]" with no "[", empty stack function would be handy.
5. Similarly, for cases like "[" with no "]", empty stack in reverse way would be handy but making sure where to put the conditional.


**Time Complexity: Travelling a String with N characters, so O(N)
**Space Complexity: In place Stack Used with N chars from input string, O(N)
